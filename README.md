* File **03-Regression-Techniques** explores regression techniques including linear and cubic models. It evaluates performance using RSS and ANOVA, includes diagnostic graphs and their analyses for model assesment.
* In **11-Model-Perf-ROC.qmd** file, Ridge,Lasso and Random Forest models are applied in order to examine the relationship between the mpg01 target variable and other features from the built-in Auto dataset. The models' performances were evaluated using ROC curves and AUC scores to determine which model performed better.
